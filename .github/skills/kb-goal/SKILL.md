description: Durable objective governor for KB workflows. Use when the user sets a goal, wants work to run for days across sessions, says continue until done, asks for vDone, or needs a long-lived objective forced through KB routing, planning, work, completion, and proof gates. Owns goal state and stop conditions; delegates execution to kb-start, kb-task, kb-epic, klfg, kb-work, and kb-complete.

# KB Goal

Own the durable objective, not the implementation lane.

`kb-goal` is the durable-objective lane for work that can span days. It keeps
the objective, terminal proof, blockers, next action, and restart state honest
while the normal KB lanes do the actual work.

Do not use chat confidence as a completion signal. A goal is complete only when
the routed KB lane reaches its proof gate and that proof satisfies the original
goal contract.

## Contract

- Run `kb-map lookup <goal>` before creating, resuming, or routing a goal.
- Store goal state in the active repo, not in global memory or chat history.
- Route each work unit through `kb-start` unless the ledger already names a
  valid next action such as `kb-work <manifest>` or `kb-complete <manifest>`.
- Preserve the smallest correct lane. Do not force every goal through `klfg`.
- Continue across sessions by updating the goal ledger and active handoff before
  stopping.
- Mark complete only after terminal proof matches the goal's done criteria.
- Mark blocked only with exact blocker, attempted route, and resume condition.

## Goal Ledger

Create or update:

```text
docs/context/goals/<goal-slug>.md
```

Also add a compact pointer in `todo.md` while the goal is active.

Use this shape:

```markdown
# <Goal Name>

Status: active|blocked|complete|parked
Created: YYYY-MM-DD
Last updated: YYYY-MM-DD

## Objective

One sentence.

## Done Criteria

- <observable condition>

## Terminal Proof

- <command, gate, artifact, or review condition required before completion>

## Current State

- Current artifact: <manifest/epic/handoff/path or none>
- Next allowed action: <exact KB command>
- Last proof: <command/artifact/status or none>

## Work Units

| Unit | Route | Artifact | Status | Proof |
|---|---|---|---|---|

## Blockers

| Blocker | Type | Owner | Resume Condition |
|---|---|---|---|

## Notes
```

Keep the ledger compact. Move routine history into `todo-done.md` when the goal
closes.

## Routing

Pick the next smallest useful unit, then delegate:

| Goal State | Route |
|---|---|
| One bounded task can finish the goal | `kb-task` |
| Small known bug or contained fix | `kb-fix` |
| Broken behavior needs diagnosis | `kb-troubleshoot` |
| Clear feature needs slices | `kb-plan` -> `kb-work` -> `kb-complete` |
| Fuzzy objective or high path dependency | `kb-brainstorm` -> `kb-plan` -> `kb-work` -> `kb-complete` |
| Many streams, blockers, or manifests | `kb-epic`, then run each produced manifest |
| User wants one strict idea-to-done pipeline | `klfg` |
| Valid manifest already exists | `kb-work <manifest>` -> `kb-complete <manifest>` |
| Work is implemented and needs terminal gates | `kb-complete <manifest>` |
| Release or deploy is the remaining unit | `kb-ship` |

`klfg` is one strict pipeline run. `kb-goal` may run many pipeline runs.

### Goal Brainstorm Rule

Inside a goal, brainstorming should minimize human stops. The agent should pick
the best path from repo evidence, prior requirements, safe assumptions, and
research whenever that is enough to move forward.

Ask the user only for `ask-now` blockers: product choices, safety approvals,
credentials/access, irreversible tradeoffs, or ambiguity that would make the
plan wrong. Resolve `research-first` with research. Carry `safe-assumption`,
`defer-to-planning`, and `parked` items in the ledger with rationale instead of
turning them into questions.

## Loop

1. **Restore** - read `todo.md`, `docs/context/PROJECT.md`, and the goal ledger.
2. **Check staleness** - if the next artifact is older than 72 hours, run the
   normal stale-work refresh before execution.
3. **Choose next unit** - identify the smallest work unit that moves the goal.
4. **Delegate** - invoke the route from the ledger or route through `kb-start`.
5. **Verify unit** - require the delegated lane's gate evidence.
6. **Update ledger** - record artifact, status, proof, blocker, and next action.
7. **Decide**:
   - if done criteria and terminal proof are satisfied, mark `complete`;
   - if more units remain, continue or write a handoff and resume next session;
   - if blocked, record exact resume criteria and stop honestly.

Do not stop at weaker milestones:

- one work unit passed;
- a manifest says all slices are done but `kb-complete` has not run;
- tests passed before review/follow-up proof;
- `klfg` emitted DONE for one pipeline but the goal has remaining criteria;
- the model believes the objective is probably satisfied.

## Completion Rules

Complete only when all are true:

- the ledger `Done Criteria` are satisfied;
- the latest delegated route has terminal proof;
- every active manifest is `complete`, `reviewed`, `parked`, or explicitly
  blocked with resume criteria;
- unresolved P0/P1 findings are absent;
- final verification commands or artifacts are recorded;
- memory/handoff state points to the completed goal or no longer points to it.

If `kb-complete` creates follow-up work, keep the goal open and route that work
through the smallest valid KB lane.

## Blocked Rules

A goal is blocked only when further agent work would be fake progress.

Valid blockers include:

- missing credentials, MFA, paid access, hardware, or private data;
- product decision with multiple reasonable outcomes;
- unsafe/destructive action awaiting approval;
- external service outage or unavailable dependency;
- verification cannot run and no safe substitute exists;
- repeated gate failure with no new evidence path.

When blocked, write:

- exact blocker;
- what was attempted;
- current artifact;
- next allowed action after unblock;
- whether unrelated units can continue.

## Output

During work, report only:

- active goal;
- next route;
- current gate/proof;
- blocker or next action.

Final output:

```text
Goal: <name>
Status: complete|blocked|active
Route(s): <routes actually run>
Proof: <commands/artifacts/gates>
Next: <exact next action or none>
```
