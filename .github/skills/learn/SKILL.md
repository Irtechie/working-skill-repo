# /learn — Extract Patterns into Instincts

Analyze recent work (observations, git history, solutions) and extract reusable "instincts" — small learned behaviors with confidence scoring.

## When to Use

- After completing a feature or fixing a bug
- At the end of a coding session
- When you want to capture a pattern you noticed
- Periodically to keep the project's knowledge current

## Execution Flow

### Step 1: Gather Evidence

Run these in parallel to collect data:

1. **Git history** — `git log --oneline -20` for recent commits
2. **Recent diffs** — `git diff HEAD~5..HEAD --stat` for what changed
3. **Observations** — Read `.kb/observations.jsonl` for tool use patterns from hooks (optional; learning works without this feed)
4. **Existing instincts** — Read `docs/context/kb/instincts/project.yaml` and, if a narrower scope is active, `docs/context/kb/instincts/scoped/<scope-path>.yaml` (create if missing)
5. **Solutions** — Read `docs/solutions/` for documented patterns
6. **Steering memory** — Read any current goal or manifest steering-memory path
   named by the caller, such as a `Live Steering` ledger section or
   `docs/context/operations/steering/<slug>.md`
7. **Curated external evidence** — When the caller supplies papers, meeting
   discussions, or other external sources, first turn them into a bounded
   evidence summary that:
   - records source identity and date;
   - separates direct findings from interpretation;
   - removes private names, quotes, links, and unrelated details;
   - pairs claimed improvements with counterevidence and limits;
   - routes domain-specific lessons to the narrowest owning scope.

### Step 2: Analyze Patterns

Look for recurring patterns across the evidence:

**Code style patterns:**
- Error handling conventions (wrapping, custom types, sentinel errors)
- Naming conventions (variable, function, file naming)
- Import organization preferences
- Comment style and documentation patterns

**Workflow patterns:**
- Test-first vs test-after behavior
- Commit granularity preferences
- Branch naming conventions
- Review practices

**Architecture patterns:**
- Package/module organization
- Dependency injection style
- Interface usage patterns
- Configuration management approach

**Tool usage patterns** (from observations.jsonl):
- Frequently used shell commands
- Common file editing sequences
- Preferred build/test commands

**Steering feedback patterns** (from curated steering memory):
- Permanent scope constraints or false-positive areas
- Reviewer preferences that should change future target selection
- Controller-selection guidance for recurring goals
- Durable "do this next time" feedback repeated across runs

Do not learn directly from raw transcripts, unclassified PR comments, or
one-off instructions. A transcript may only contribute after the relevant
claims have been curated as external evidence under Step 1. If feedback only
applied to the current PR, leave it out of project instincts.

### Step 2.5: Apply Recency Decay

Before creating or updating instincts, apply time-based decay to all existing entries:

1. For each instinct in the active scope file (`docs/context/kb/instincts/scoped/<scope-path>.yaml` or `docs/context/kb/instincts/project.yaml`):
   - Calculate days since `last_seen`
   - Apply decay: `new_confidence = confidence × 0.5^(days_since_last_seen / 90)`
   - Update the confidence value in place

2. **Archive stale instincts:**
   - If decayed confidence falls below 0.3, move the instinct to `docs/context/kb/instincts/archive/YYYY-MM-DD-archived.yaml`
   - Add `archived_reason: confidence decayed below 0.3 (last seen: <date>)`
   - Remove from the source scope file

3. Write updated confidence values back to the scope file before proceeding to Step 3.

**Half-life rationale:** 90 days balances stability (project conventions rarely change weekly) with freshness (patterns unused for 6+ months are likely obsolete). At 90 days, an unobserved instinct at 0.85 decays to:
- 30 days: 0.68
- 90 days: 0.43
- 180 days: 0.21 (archived)

### Step 3: Create or Update Instincts

For each new pattern discovered, create an instinct entry.
For patterns that match existing instincts, increase confidence and observation count.

Before creating or updating an instinct from feedback, classify it:

| Route | Use When | Durable Output |
|---|---|---|
| `current-only` | Feedback only changes the active PR/session | manifest or PR note only |
| `steering-memory` | Feedback should steer future target selection but is not yet a broad instinct | goal ledger or `docs/context/operations/steering/<slug>.md` |
| `observation` | Feedback is an evidence point for later pattern extraction | `.kb/observations.jsonl` |
| `scoped-instinct` | Ordinary lesson owned by one scope **(DEFAULT)** | `docs/context/kb/instincts/scoped/<scope-path>.yaml` |
| `landmine-candidate` | Verified repo-specific trap — instant one-shot fast-path at owning scope | `docs/context/landmines.md` + owning scope file |
| `instinct-evidence` | Pattern proven across sibling scopes via promotion-on-recurrence only | ancestor scope file or `docs/context/kb/instincts/project.yaml` |

Ordinary lessons default to `scoped-instinct` at the narrowest owning scope. `instinct-evidence` (a higher tier) is reached only via promotion-on-recurrence. One verified high-severity trap may become a landmine candidate, but ordinary
preferences need repeated evidence before becoming instincts. Steering memory is
the middle layer: it changes future loop behavior without pretending the pattern
is ready to become a reusable skill.

Measured learning changes that claim a better agent behavior must pass the
adoption gate before they can be promoted beyond local/scoped use:

```bash
go run ./cmd/kbcheck learning-adoption --result-path <results.json>
```

The results must include at least 20 samples, no right-to-wrong regressions, no
holdout string leakage, and either a two-case net gain or a 10 percentage point
gain. Rejected candidates may still be recorded as scoped/experimental evidence,
but they must not become shared/project/global rules.

#### Scope declaration

A skill determines its active scope in this priority order:

1. An explicit `scope:` argument passed to `/learn`
2. The workflow/domain of the touched surface (e.g. edits under an `audio` pipeline imply `scope: audio`)
3. Fallback `scope: project` only when no narrower scope is identifiable — **never fall back to global**

#### Pull rule

When working in scope `S`, load the active scope file + all ancestors (up to `project`, then `global`). Never load sibling scopes. Example:

```
working in audio/voice-eval  →  load: audio/voice-eval, audio, project, global
                                 never:  image, video, motion, image/comparer
```

#### Promotion-on-recurrence

The **only** path for a lesson to climb to a higher scope tier: when the same `trigger`+`behavior` pattern independently recurs across **≥ 2 sibling scopes**, write a generalized instinct to their **nearest common ancestor** (not straight to global), citing the originating scopes as evidence.

| Recurs in | Promotes to |
|---|---|
| `audio/tts` and `audio/sfx` | `audio` |
| `audio` and `image` | `project` |
| domain-neutral, recurs across projects | `global` |

No lesson reaches `global` by any other path.

**Instinct format** (stored in `docs/context/kb/instincts/scoped/<scope-path>.yaml` for workflow/component scopes, or `docs/context/kb/instincts/project.yaml` for `scope: project` / `scope: global`):

```yaml
instincts:
  - id: kebab-case-unique-id
    scope: audio/voice-eval        # narrowest owning scope; default is NOT project
    trigger: "when [specific situation]"
    behavior: "do [specific action]"
    confidence: 0.5
    domain: code-style|testing|architecture|error-handling|workflow|tooling
    observations: 1
    first_seen: YYYY-MM-DD
    last_seen: YYYY-MM-DD
    evidence:
      - "commit abc123: wrapped all errors with fmt.Errorf"
      - "observed 3 times in observations.jsonl"
```

**Confidence rules:**
- New instinct starts at 0.5
- Each additional observation: +0.1 (capped at 0.95)
- Contradictory evidence: -0.15
- No observations for 30 days: -0.1
- Minimum: 0.1 (below this, remove the instinct)

### Step 3.5: Capture Landmine Candidates

A landmine is not a generic lesson. It is a verified repo-specific trap the
model is likely to miss without an explicit warning.

Only create a landmine candidate when the evidence shows at least one of:

- the model already made the mistake;
- the repo convention conflicts with common defaults;
- a command, sync path, runtime, auth mode, or generated artifact has a specific
  failure mode;
- a workflow gate is likely to be skipped;
- the trap is high-cost, destructive, or hard to notice from code alone.

Landmine candidates must include:

```yaml
landmine:
  severity: low|medium|high|critical
  owner_surface: "<skill, script, doc, generator, fixture, or workflow>"
  failure_mode: "<specific mistake likely without the warning>"
  evidence:
    - "<file, command, review finding, failing test, or observed mistake>"
  fix_condition: "<what change retires the landmine>"
  verification: "<command, eval, test, or review check proving the fix>"
```

Reject candidates that only say to test, read the code, keep things simple, or
follow normal engineering practice. Those are not landmines.

High-severity landmines may be recorded from one verified observation, but skill
promotion still belongs to `/evolve` and requires its promotion gate.

**Important constraints:**
- Maximum 50 active instincts per scope file (project/global bucket and each scoped file are capped independently; a busy project tier cannot crowd out scoped learning)
- Each instinct must be atomic — one trigger, one behavior
- Triggers must be specific (not "when writing code")
- Behaviors must be actionable (not "write good code")
- Evidence must cite specific commits or observations

### Step 4: Write Results

1. Write updated scope file (`docs/context/kb/instincts/scoped/<scope-path>.yaml` for workflow/component scopes, or `docs/context/kb/instincts/project.yaml` for project/global tier)
2. Ensure `docs/context/kb/instincts/` directory (and `scoped/` subdirectory if needed) exists

### Step 5: Report

Show a summary:

```
Learning complete!

New instincts:
  + always-wrap-errors (0.5) — wrap errors with fmt.Errorf using %w
  + table-driven-tests (0.5) — use table-driven test pattern for Go tests

Updated instincts:
  ↑ prefer-early-returns (0.6 → 0.7) — 1 new observation
  ↑ run-tests-before-commit (0.7 → 0.8) — 2 new observations

Ready to evolve (confidence > 0.8):
  ★ run-tests-before-commit — consider /evolve to generate a skill

Total: X instincts (Y new, Z updated)
  Instinct file: docs/context/kb/instincts/scoped/<scope-path>.yaml  (or project.yaml for project-tier)
```

## Notes

- Instincts are project-scoped and committed to the repo — the whole team benefits
- Run `/instincts` to see all learned patterns
- Run `/evolve` when instincts reach high confidence to generate full skills
- Optional observer hooks such as `.github/hooks/copilot-hooks.json` can capture tool use data when a consuming repo installs them; this portable bundle does not ship that hook file

## Tooling Availability

`cmd/kbcheck` belongs to this bundle's source repo and does not ship with an
installed skill. Treat every `go run ./cmd/kbcheck ...` command in this skill as
conditional: run it when the repo provides it, otherwise substitute the
project's own equivalent check and record which command produced the proof.
A missing harness changes which command you run, never whether you prove the work.
